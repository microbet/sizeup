          '<h1>        Frequently Asked Questions      </h1>      <h2>        What does SizeUp do and who is it meant to help?      </h2>      <p>        SizeUp helps small and medium-sized business owners make intelligent        decisions to grow their businesses. To learn more and watch        demonstrations, please visit <a href="/help/how-it-works">How It        Works</a>.      </p>      <h2>        Where does the data come from?      </h2>      <p>        Business data comes from hundreds of data sources including IRS records,        county courthouse filings, Yellow Pages and White Pages, business        publications, the U.S. Postal Service, and corporate annual reports,        which are manually reviewed and maintained. The data is verified through        over 25 million phone calls each year by third-party researchers and is        constantly updated, which means the competitiveness ranking of businesses        is recalculated with every update. This business data is similar to and        includes the type of data used by the majority of the Fortune 100        companies, the most used search engines, and even GPS-based auto        navigation systems.      </p>      <p>        <iframe src=        "//player.vimeo.com/video/197202801?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"        width="350" height="263" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen=""        allowfullscreen=""></iframe>      </p>      <p>              </p>      <p>        Demographic, labor force, consumer, education, innovation, occupation, transportation, environmental, incentive, and entrepreneurship data comes from a wide range of public and private data sources including, but not limited to, the US Census, United States Postal Service, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau estimates, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Medicare statistics, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Federal Aviation Office, US Environmental Protection Agency, US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and commercial data providers. Data is updated on a        varying schedule depending on the dataset. Demographic data includes        current year projections using proprietary data for most data points.      </p>      <p>        Because much of the data provided by public sources is not updated        frequently enough to make real-time business decisions (such as the US        Census), data is projected to the present-year using proprietary methods.        The methodology follows rigorous quantitative analysis standards which        follow best practices in statistics, economics, demography, geography,        corporate site selection, and economic development. In addition, SizeUp        uses our proprietary methodology for analyzing information from all of        the datasets.      </p>      <p>        Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data comes from a variety of        sources. The base map data is provided through Google Maps and its data        vendors. However, for business decision success, companies need a much        higher level of geographic data accuracy, robustness, and information        than is currently provided on any of the major search engine map        websites. SizeUp overlays this needed business, demographic, and other        geo-referenced community characteristics over Google Maps. In addition,        local governments have extremely accurate geographic layers of data which        is relevant for businesses and can save/make businesses a lot of money in        better decision making and time-savings, but this data has been locked        away in the computers of government engineers. SizeUp has access to this        data through GIS Planning''s 14 years of client partnerships with state        and local government economic development organizations across the USA.      </p>      <h2>        What industries are included?      </h2>      <p>        SizeUp includes information on thousands of industries. To be included,        an industry must be one in which the typical business produces revenue.        This excludes many industries primarily funded by government and        religious institutions. Industries included on SizeUp must also comprise        at least 1,000 businesses nationwide.      </p>      <h2>        What do the graphs mean?      </h2>      <p>        There are a variety of charts and graphs created for you on SizeUp. One        of the most common is a chart that compares your business to the        performance of similar businesses in your industry located in your same        city, county, metro, and state compared to the nation. You can use this        graph to compare your business to how similar businesses which compete in        your industry are performing in different locations.      </p>      <h2>        Is my company''s information kept confidential?      </h2>      <p>        All individual information you submit to SizeUp to evaluate the        competitiveness of your company is kept completely confidential and is        only for your use.
