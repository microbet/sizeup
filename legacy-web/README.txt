This is an IIS website that appears to be dedicated to redirecting URLs of legacy domains. Create an IIS site and copy the contents of "wwwroot" into its content directory. You will need to bind the site to the following hostnames:

lbi.sizeup.com
sizeuplbi.com
www.sizeuplbi.com

Historical note: The files here were taken from szup-prod-www01 in January 2018. They appear to have been added there without first paying a visit to source control. Timestamps suggest that the hostnames above were functional starting August 2014, then deprecated and replaced with redirects in August 2016.
