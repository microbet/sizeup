== To make an AWS ETL database instance ==

From our private "gisp-calc-db02" AMI (ID=ami-fa582aed), launch an instance (I tried c4.large and named it "calc-test" in AWS console). Not sure how to get a hostname to DC.

Couldn't log in anyway: "There are currently no logon servers to perform the logon request." But since it's a custom AMI, Amazon won't generate an Administrator password (as in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html). Onerous process to reset that password (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ResettingAdminPassword_EC2Config.html) is okay once but not for every instance. If we're going to mint a new AMI anyway, maybe upgrade some stuff first.
